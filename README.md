# Marketing-Analytics-Case-Study
# Overview 
In this Marketing Analytics Case, we needed to generate necessary data points necessary to populate the template attached below for a fictional company, DVD Rental Co. 

The requirements were as follows: 
1. Top 2 Categories 
> For each customer, we need to identify the top 2 categories for each customer based off their past rental history. These top categories will drive marketing creative images as seen in the travel and sci-fi examples in the draft email.

2. Category Film Recommendations
> 3 most popular films for each customer’s top 2 categories. We cannot recommend a film which the customer has already viewed. If there are less than 3 films available - marketing is happy to show at least 1 film.

3. Individual Customer Insights
> How many total films have they watched in their top category?
> How many more films has the customer watched compared to the average DVD Rental Co customer?
> How does the customer rank in terms of the top X% compared to all other customers in this film category?

4. Second Ranking Category
> How many total films has the customer watched in this category?
> What proportion of each customer’s total films watched does
